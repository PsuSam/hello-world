Hi there, I enjoy writing well designed and well written code. I also enjoy deploying and delivering software and seeing other find it helpful and/or usefull. I mostly write in JAVA because it is a cross-platform language, it is strongly typed and very resistant to run-time crashes. I also enjoy JavaScript because it is cross-platform, basically.

Spicy and flavorful foods are great and im not picky about the origin or look of the food.
